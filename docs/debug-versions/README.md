# Debug Versions Archive

This folder contains the original versions of key files with all console logs intact.

## Files:

- `index-with-logs.js`: Entry point with console debugging commands
- `UIManager-with-logs.js`: Original UI manager with debug logging
- `Game-with-logs.js`: Original game logic with console game functionality
- `Player-with-logs.js`: Original player/AI logic with debug logs

## Purpose:

Preserve the debugging and development journey. These files show:

1. How the game evolved from console to UI
2. Debugging patterns used during development
3. The original "console game" implementation

## Note:

The main codebase (`src/`) has been cleaned for production deployment.
